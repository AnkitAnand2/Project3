Bike Rental Prediction
In this report, the count of a bike rented is detected using machine learning
algorithms. From the given data, a feature of different set of variables is extracted by analysing the
correlation plot. Different variables which are not useful for predicting the target variable are dropped. Using
this feature data, different models are built: Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN classifier,
KFold cross validation. Final prediction of the bike rental count on daily based on the environmental and seasonal
settings is made from the model. From the given modelâ€™s best performance was with Random Forest model,
which is then implemented on the given test data for the final bike rental count.
